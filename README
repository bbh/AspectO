Copyright (C) 2006 Basilio Briceno Hernandez <bbh@briceno.mx>

These are the release notes for AspectO version 0.3.
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about,
and what to do if something goes wrong.

WHAT IS AspectO?

  AspectO is a free (LGPL) set of classes written in PHP to bring support to
  AOP. This classes provides a very simple and easy to learn syntax, doesn't
  requires binary extensions additional to a common PHP installation, obtains
  the content from classes using PCRE and the PHP's Object Reflection, and
  finally weaves your Aspects preprocessing the source code.

  It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details.

ON WHAT IT RUNS?

  You can run this on any hardware that runs PHP 5.2.x or higher.

REQUIREMENTS

  It requires the PHP binary extension PCRE that is included by default in PHP.

DOCUMENTATION:

  AspectO uses three basic directories, one for your Aspects files, another for
  your classes and a final one for the weaved classes. The way it works is
  setting the paths of your directories as properties of the AspectOConf object,
  the AspectO object receives the AspecOConf object and calls the AspectOParser
  and the AspectoClassParser to compare your Aspects versus your Classes,
  checks if they are compatible and finally return them as fixed objects to the
  AspectOWeaver, it weaves both objects (classes and aspects) and returns weaved
  classes in the weaved classes directory.

  The syntax of an Aspect in AspectO is very simple and consists of joinpoints,
  pointcuts and advices. AspectO provides three types of joinpoints: execution,
  call and construction; and three types of advices: after, before and around.
